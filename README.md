## PyBuses
# used libaries: pandas, matplotlib
This is my final project for Python Programming Course on University of Warsaw.        
It consists of two Python modules that provide functions to harvest data about the locations of buses from Warsaw City Hall API and then analyze their speeds.   
The Jupyter Notebook visible in the main folder is a presentation of fully utilizing the capability of those modules with my conclusions after analyzing the data.
